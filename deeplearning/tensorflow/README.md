## TensorFlow examples

#### The following directory is comprised of a number of deep learning examples using TensorFlow 2.x. The examples utilize various public datasets (MNIST) as well as a few datasets from a Coursera Deep Learning with TensorFlow specialization. The datasets themselves were too large for GitHub, so please contact @ericbaumann for access.

#### The examples explain concepts including CNNs, LSTMs, NLP, and Transfer learning.

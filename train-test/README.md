// instructions about running the code and the dataset and other relevant information. I recommend adding a brief about what the goal of the file is and what is the expected output.

The code for train test split is in a Jupyter notebook that depends on the dataset falldetection.csv in the dataset folder.

After viewing this, you can successfully
1. Use sklearn library to perform a train test split 
2. How to resolve the issue of data imbalance
3. Perform and evaluate cross validation results

How to run this code?
Once you have cloned the repository, and assuming you have python installed follow these steps

1. Run jupyter notebook in your terminal ( root structure of this project )
2. Follow the folder structure and open Train_Test_Validation.ipynb
3. Run each cell on the jupyter notebook using [shift + Enter] or the RUN cell on the top
4. Make sure you have the dataset in the same directory as on the code, if not point it to the same directory
5. Run every cell one by one to understand the output. ( Comments have been provided to help you walk through the output )

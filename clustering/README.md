## Running the code

The code above is in a jupyter notebook so there is little work needed to run the code (assuming you have jupyter instealled). Simply start jupyter notebook and use `shift + enter` to run each cell.

### The dataset
For simplicity the dataset is pre-loaded from scikitlearn

## Clustering
Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. In general terms we aim to find common way to group values in the dataset. 


### K-means

K-means is a clustering algorithm that tries to partition a set of points into K sets (clusters) such that the points in each cluster tend to be near each other. It is unsupervised because the points have no external classification. Common ways to calculate distance include eucledian distance and manhattan distance.


### K-NN
K-nearest neighbors is a classification (or regression) algorithm that in order to determine the classification of a point, combines the classification of the K nearest points. It is supervised because you are trying to classify a point based on the known classification of other points.

## Libraries used
The general libraries used in Python for data science work are:
1) Pandas: famous library for data manipulation and analysis. Has builtin data structures (dataframes, series) and operations to manipulate datasets and time series.

2) Numpy: NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

3) SKLearn: Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, k-neighbours, and k-means. It also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

4) Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

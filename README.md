# data-science-toolbox
The goal of this repository is to present fellow Headstormers with various ways to explore and learn data science through examples and best practices that we have established as a SIG. This is an evolving project and we'll continue things to it regularly. If you are interested in contributing or have any specific topics you would like data science SIG to explore, please reach out to us through Slack.


### Project Structure
Each directory in the toolbox should have its own README file, if it doesn't please create a PR to update it and explain that topic. 


### Running the code
There is no unfirom way of running any of the code in here because it all depends on the set up for each sub-project listed above. Follow the instructions listed in the project specific README for best results
